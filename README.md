# hello-world
For the first time ever, an open-source code than can be understood by everyone.

So this is how github looks like from the other side. The markdown editor looks really cool. I finally know what a "pull request" means (I should probably have used context clues and understood it a lot sooner.....huh)

Anywho. I'm a novice programmer. For me, reading open-source code is like reading a book where all the pages are written in different languages. Also, they're jumbled.

Well, no more. For the first time ever (after everyone else), I've written a piece of code that can be understood by anyone, anywhere regardless of race, gender, programming ability or overall intelligence. 

Without any further ado, I write these words for the thousandth time.

HELLO F*CKING WORLD!!!!!!
